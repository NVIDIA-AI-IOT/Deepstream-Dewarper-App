Prequisites:

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps.

You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

Compilation Steps:
  $ cd apps/deepstream-dewarper-app/
  $ make
  $ ./deepstream-dewarper-app [<uri1> <camera_id1>] [<uri2> <camera_id2>] ... [<uriN> <camera_idN>]
e.g.
  // Single Stream
  $ ./deepstream-dewarper-app file:///home/nvidia/sample_cam6.mp4 6

  // Single Stream for Perspective Projection type (needs config file change)
  $ ./deepstream-dewarper-app file:///home/nvidia/yoga.mp4 0

  // Multi Stream
  $ ./deepstream-dewarper-app file:///home/nvidia/sample_cam6.mp4 6 file:///home/nvidia/sample_cam6.mp4 6

  // Multi Stream for Perspective Projection type (needs config file change)
  $ ./deepstream-dewarper-app file:///home/nvidia/yoga.mp4 0 file:///home/nvidia/yoga.mp4 0

This document shall describe the sample deepstream-dewarper-test application.
The following description focus on the default use-case of parking garage 360
cameras with spots and ailes surfaces but you can also use it to test other
types of applications like a single surface Perspection Projection use-case
(see Note below).
For more information on the general functionality and further examples see the
DeepStream Plugin Development Guide.


Two configuration files are provided:
   . config_dewarper.txt (default): tailors the 360 camera multi-surface use-case
   . config_dewarper_perspective.txt: single-surface Perspective Projection
use-case. To use this you should rename this file to config_dewarper.txt or
change the application code (line 278) to have a different input file name.

Note: For Perspective Projection Dewarping the use of the CSV Files is not
supported. In this case please provide the parameters under each [surface*]
group.
To change the number of surfaces in use change the property "num-batch-buffers".
It should match the number of "surfaces" groups in the configuration file. So if
you want two surfaces per buffer you should have "num-batch-buffers"=2 and two
surfaces groups ([surface0] and [surface1]). Default value is 4.


Parameters:
uri - represents the input video stream

camera_id - refers to the first column of the CSV files (i.e. csv_files/nvaisle_2M.csv & csv_files/nvspot_2M.csv)
The dewarping parameters for the given camera are read from CSV files and used
to generate dewarp surfaces (i.e. multiple aisle and spot surface) from 360d
input video stream.

Output:
For the 360 camera use-case there are total 4 surfaces generated by dewarper
plugin based on the inputs from spot and aisle CSV files.
Both these CSV files mentions 2 surfaces each. All 4 surfaces are scaled to
common resolution i.e. 960x752.
Example video stream containing 360d video recorded in Car Parking Area
Aisle area is where vehicle moves
Spot area is where cars get parked
Surfaces generated by dewarper plugin are as per below sequence
1) Spot Surface-1 - Spot surface generated by dewarper plugin is of 3886x666 resolution, then its been scaled to common
   resolution i.e. 960x752 by keeping aspect ratio. This results into black pixel padding at the bottom of this surface
2) Spot Surface-2 - Same as Spot Surface-1, only difference is different dewarp parameters used to generate this surface.
3) Aisle Surface-1 - Aisle surface generated by dewarper plugin is of 1902x1500 resolution, then its been scaled to
   common resolution i.e. 960x752 by keeping aspect ratio.
4) Aisle Surface-2 - Same as Aisle Surface-1, only difference is different dewarp parameters used to generate this surface.
Once all 4 surfaces are generated, these are grouped under NvBufSurface structure and passed to the downstream component
for further processing.

As mentioned, you can use this test for other examples (non-aisle/spot
360 camera use-case). In this case the expected output is similar, except the
number of output surfaces might be different and the csv_files are not used.

Note:
gst-nvdewarper plugin uses "VRWorks 360 Video SDK".
